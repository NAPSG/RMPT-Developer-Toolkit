The Resource Management Planning Tool v1.0 was developed by the National Alliance for Public Safety GIS (NAPSG) Foundation and the International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC). 

The goal of this tool is to integrate a strong risk analysis based resource planning and allocation suite of tools or capability within existing mutual aid and crisis management systems to:

- Enable risk information to be rapidly integrated into existing crisis management and mutual aid systems
- Increase the accessibility and usage of risk and resource information within existing systems to improve decision making prior to and during an event
- Enable operators and decision makers to make better resource management decisions during the preparedness phase through readiness and in response in an event requiring mutual aid
- Stakeholders identified a 6-step process for successful resource and mutual aid planning. This tool helps to address steps 1 - 3.
